First Time diving in a FullStack Application

What I've learned so far:

First contact with Spring. It fulfills very well what is expected of a framework, which is to provide me with tools that streamline work. I hope to delve deeper into the subject since I see it daily in many job vacancies.

@Annotations are an incredible tool to provide information/instructions to the code in a simple and direct way.

First contact with Postgre. Always a challenge to set up and start using a tool from scratch, but everything went well. Using a database via cmd was something new, and I had no major issues.

Everything in Java is new to me since I started studying the language less than a month ago, but it is certainly less intimidating than most people make it out to be. I can say that I enjoyed the experience and will continue on the journey.
